The game can be played user vs. user by turning off the AI in the Game Setup for the Player 1 under "Red Team".
It is set to default to user vs. AI.

The settings in the Game Setup should be left to their default as the game was not
properly adapted to work with other settings - bugs may occur. 

The game is designed around the Gamepad therefore Gamepad is recommended but it 
can also be played with keyboard by setting the keys in the Input section when turning On the game.

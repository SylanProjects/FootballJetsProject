# Football Jets - Football game with AI written in Unity using C#
**About**

This project is a topdown shooter/football game written in Unity Engine using C# programming language.
I have also designed a fairly complex Artificial Intelligence for this game that makes sophisticated decisions based 
on the actions taken by the player during the game. The full AI behaviour is explained in the chapter 3.5 of the Report. 
This game was designed from the bottom up by me for a Master's Dissertation project. 

**Important**

/FootballJets/Assets/Scripts includes the entire code written for this project.

/FootballJets/ includes all of the project files. 

/ReportBackup/Questionnaires includes the Questionnaire and the answers (quest1 - 5)

/FootballJets/Build/ includes the runnable build of the game for PC, Mac and Linux.

The game can be played user vs. user by turning off the AI in the Game Setup for the Player 1 under "Red Team".
It is set to default to user vs. AI.

The settings in the Game Setup should be left to their default as the game was not
properly adapted to work with other settings - bugs may occur. 

The game is designed around the Gamepad therefore Gamepad is recommended but it 
can also be played with keyboard by setting the keys in the Input section when turning On the game.
